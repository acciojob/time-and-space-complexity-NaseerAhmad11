	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>The time complexity of an algorithm is a measure of the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. An algorithm is considered efficient if it has a low time complexity.</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> is a measure of the amount of computer memory (space) that an algorithm uses to solve a specific problem as a function of the size of the input to the algorithm. When we say that an algorithm has a space complexity of O(n), it means that the amount of space required by the algorithm grows linearly with the size of the input.</p>
